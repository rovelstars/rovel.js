# Rovel OS
Yes! You read it correct! rovel.js will now include Rovel OS! But first things first! Install rovel.js globally in order to use our OS!
`npm i rovel.js -g`

Now type `rovelos-install` and our installer will start installing our OS on your device!
More good news, like text editor, and music player will come out soon! So be ready to get awesome stuff on your device! (Note: Rovel OS is based on terminal, and therefore you need **TTY** terminal so our OS runs perfectly. For more information, Please join our Discord server.


 Updates in **1.1.2**
 - Added Rovel OS beta! Be ready to try it out!
 - Added some more packages!

 Updates in **1.1.1** :
 - Added Python Shell! (*note: python must bt installed in your system to execute python codes and files*)
 - Added Notifier for our package! If you're running an older version from 1.1.1, you will get a red warning to update your rovel.js pakcage with us! Same as, if your'e using beta versions from github, there will be a green notification for thanks for installing beta builds!
 - Added Net-Speed! And you can install it too!
 - Added api querying for npm packages!
 - Added Number Approxer, like converting 1000 into 1k
 - Added Lodash like functions, and I give credits to lodash for creating those!
 - Added Node Emoji, which is a package exclusively for emojis in your code.
 - Added test.js file which tests our pkg fully!
 - Update: If you just want to use a part of our pkg, like you are using emojis only from our code, you can load that only, thus decreasing memory usage and starting your code more fast. If you want to use this, do like this:
 ```js
 const emoji = require('rovel.js/extra/node-emoji');
 console.log(emoji.get("sunglasses")+" I work!");
 ```
 the list of parts are:
 - ansi-colors 
 - approx        
 - did-you-mean  
 - node-emoji
 - api-npm      
 - commander.js  
 - lodash        
 - node-fetch
 - python-shell
 - network-speed

 Please note that this parts' name will be changed within some days.
