[![Rovel.js](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=rovel&message=js&color=red&style=for-the-badge&logo=npm)](https://npmjs.com/package/rovel.js) **The NPM package we all wanted!**

# 1.1.8 | Improvements
We added `supports-colors` & `pkgjs` plugins while we removed the Thank you message whenever you used rovel.js
Instead, the thank you message will popup when you install rovel.js :smile:
Also we made `text` plugin use `supports-colors` by default so you don't get any random \ texts if your terminal dosen't supports colors.

# 1.1.7 | Added Time Plugin!
Also we now have our docs running [here](https://rovelstars.ga) although its 90% completed.

# 1.1.6 | Removed ts badge from our npm site link
Since we don't use typescript, we don't love that badge besie our name. Also, we decreased our code again!
Even though no new Update, but we are commiting 50+ files update!
